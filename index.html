        <h2>History</h2>
        <div>
         <h3>Early Life</h3>
         <p>Jonathon Bialas was born in Houston in December of 1994. He attended Alvin Community College
           and graduated in 2015. He then attended the University of Houston and recieved a BS in Physics.
           At the same time, he maried and tried to settle down in South Houston.</p>

          <h3>Reajusting</h3>
          <p>Unfortunatly, things were tough. He couldn't find a job with his degree. It turns out he would
             have to go to graduate school if he wanted that, but he couldn't get together what he needed to
             do that. Jonathon floundered from one overqualified job to the next befor becoming a substitute 
             teacher. At the same time, his wife left him, and he began the next leg of his life journey.   
          </p>

          <h3>And then...</h3>
          <p>The pandemic struck! It was awful. First, he was out of work. Then when he went back,
            the kids were ill behaved. Finally, the rising threat of violence and disease showed Jonathon 
            that it was time for a change. Two years in, he signed up for The Flatiron School and Changed his
            life forever.
